## Proxy
The option `--proxy` uses [Proxybroker](https://github.com/constverum/ProxyBroker) which will run a local proxy server on port 8888 and request 5 HTTPS proxies. You don't need to search for public proxies, everything is done automatically. Note that proxies are public.

## PwnDB
PwnDB is a TOR service which contains
data from 1.4 billion breach compilations. Before using `--pwndb` ensure that tor has been 
installed, started and listening 9050 port

Results `python check.py somebody@example.com --pwndb`
